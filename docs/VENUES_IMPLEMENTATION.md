# Venues & Bookings System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Complete implementation of a venues and booking system for Athlifyr, enabling gyms, CrossFit boxes, PT studios, and other fitness venues to manage memberships, plans, sessions, and bookings with granular RBAC per venue.

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Sport Venues

- Venues can offer multiple sports (e.g., CrossFit, HYROX, Open Gym)
- Sport types tracked at venue level for filtering and categorization
- Sessions tagged with specific sports for detailed classification
- Supports hierarchical organization:
  - Venue → Sports → Plans/Sessions → Bookings

### 2. Multi-Venue Membership System

- Users can be members of multiple venues simultaneously
- Each venue membership has independent role and status
- Four role levels: OWNER > ADMIN > COACH > CLIENT
- Four status states: PENDING, ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, LEFT

### 3. Flexible Plan System (Modalidades)

Plans control access and enforce booking limits through JSON policy:

```typescript
{
  maxBookingsPerDay: 1,           // Limit bookings per day
  maxBookingsPerWeek: 3,          // Limit bookings per week
  maxActiveBookings: 5,           // Limit future bookings
  allowedStartTimeFrom: "18:00",  // Time window restrictions
  allowedStartTimeTo: "22:00",    // Time window restrictions
  allowedWeekdays: [1,2,3,4,5],  // Monday-Friday only
  allowedServiceTypes: ["CLASS"]  // CLASS or APPOINTMENT
}
```

### 3. Session Management

Two session types:

- **CLASS**: Group sessions with capacity limits
- **APPOINTMENT**: 1:1 sessions (massage, PT, physio)

### 4. Smart Booking Validation

Comprehensive validation enforces all plan policies:

- ✅ Membership status (must be ACTIVE)
- ✅ Active subscription required
- ✅ Capacity limits (for classes)
- ✅ Daily booking limits
- ✅ Weekly booking limits
- ✅ Time window restrictions
- ✅ Weekday restrictions
- ✅ Service type restrictions
- ✅ Prevents duplicate bookings

### 5. Invite & Join System

- **Invites**: Owners/admins invite staff (admin/coach) via token
- **Join Requests**: Users request to join as clients
- Token-based invites expire after 7 days
- Support for email or user ID invitations

## Database Schema

### New Models (7)

1. **Venue** - Core venue information
2. **VenueMember** - User membership with role and status
3. **VenueInvite** - Token-based invitations
4. **VenuePlan** - Subscription plans with policies
5. **VenueSubscription** - User's active subscription
6. **VenueSession** - Classes and appointments
7. **VenueBooking** - User bookings with status tracking

### New Enums (6)

- VenueType (7 types: CROSSFIT_BOX, GYM, PT_STUDIO, etc.)
- VenueRole (4 roles: OWNER, ADMIN, COACH, CLIENT)
- MemberStatus (4 states)
- InviteStatus (5 states)
- SessionType (2 types: CLASS, APPOINTMENT)
- BookingStatus (4 states: BOOKED, CANCELLED, NO_SHOW, ATTENDED)

## API Endpoints (18)

### Public Venues

- `GET /api/venues` - List venues with filters
- `GET /api/venues/[id]` - Venue details
- `GET /api/venues/[id]/sessions` - Sessions calendar

### Venue Management (Owner/Admin)

- `POST /api/venues` - Create venue
- `PATCH /api/venues/[id]` - Update venue
- `DELETE /api/venues/[id]` - Delete venue (soft delete)

### Membership Management

- `GET /api/venues/[id]/members` - List members
- `PATCH /api/venues/[id]/members/[userId]` - Update member role/status
- `POST /api/venues/[id]/invites` - Send invite
- `POST /api/venues/invites/[token]/accept` - Accept invite
- `POST /api/venues/[id]/join-requests` - Request to join

### Plans & Subscriptions

- `GET /api/venues/[id]/plans` - List plans
- `POST /api/venues/[id]/plans` - Create plan
- `POST /api/venues/[id]/subscriptions` - Subscribe to plan
- `GET /api/me/subscriptions` - User's subscriptions

### Sessions & Bookings

- `GET /api/venues/[id]/sessions` - List sessions
- `POST /api/venues/[id]/sessions` - Create session (coach/admin)
- `POST /api/venues/[id]/sessions/[sessionId]/book` - Book session
- `POST /api/venues/[id]/bookings/[bookingId]/cancel` - Cancel booking
- `GET /api/me/bookings` - User's bookings

## Business Logic

### Booking Validation (`lib/venues/booking-validation.ts`)

Complete validation pipeline:

1. Check membership status
2. Verify active subscription
3. Validate session exists and has capacity
4. Check for existing booking
5. Apply all plan policy rules
6. Enforce daily/weekly limits

### Authorization (`lib/venues/authorization.ts`)

RBAC enforcement:

- Role hierarchy checks
- Permission verification
- Fine-grained access control for:
  - Venue management
  - Session management
  - Booking views

## UI Components

### Pages

1. **Venues List** (`/[locale]/venues`)
   - Grid display with filters
   - Venue cards with stats
   - Pagination support

2. **Venue Detail** (`/[locale]/venues/[slug]`)
   - Tabbed interface (About, Plans, Sessions, Team)
   - Plans display with subscribe CTA
   - Team member listing
   - Contact information

### Navigation

- Added "Venues" to main navigation
- Mobile navigation support
- Integrated with existing auth system

## Internationalization

Complete translations for **6 languages**:

- English (en)
- **Portuguese European (pt-PT)** - uses "tu" form
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Italian (it)

Translation coverage:

- 7 venue types
- 4 roles
- 4 member statuses
- 4 booking statuses
- Complete UI strings
- Error messages
- Form labels

## Testing

### Unit Tests (38 tests, 100% pass rate)

**Booking Validation** (9 tests):

- ✅ Membership validation
- ✅ Subscription validation
- ✅ Capacity checks
- ✅ Daily/weekly limits
- ✅ Time window restrictions
- ✅ Duplicate prevention

**Authorization** (29 tests):

- ✅ Role hierarchy
- ✅ Permission checks
- ✅ Venue management auth
- ✅ Session management auth
- ✅ Booking view auth

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. RBAC Per Venue (Not Global)

Each venue has its own permission structure, allowing users to be:

- Owner of Venue A
- Coach at Venue B
- Client at Venue C

### 2. JSON Policy for Flexibility

Plan policies stored as JSON to avoid schema migrations for new rules.

### 3. Soft Deletes

Venues are deactivated (`isActive: false`) rather than deleted to preserve data integrity.

### 4. Token-Based Invites

Secure, expiring invitation tokens prevent unauthorized access.

### 5. Modular Architecture

Isolated from Events module - zero regression risk.

## Migration Requirements

To deploy this system:

```bash
# 1. Apply Prisma schema changes
npx prisma generate

# 2. Create migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-venues-system

# 3. Push to production
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## Future Enhancements

Not implemented (out of scope):

- Sessions calendar UI (placeholder added)
- Plan update/delete endpoints
- Venue staff dashboard
- User bookings/subscriptions pages
- Payment integration
- Email notifications
- Booking cancellation policies (time-based)
- Waitlists for full sessions
- Recurring sessions
- Coach availability management

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ ESLint clean (1 minor warning)
- ✅ Prettier formatted
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks pass
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Zero regression on Events module

## Acceptance Criteria Status

All critical requirements met:

- ✅ User can subscribe to plans and become ACTIVE
- ✅ User can book sessions with smart validation
- ✅ System blocks bookings violating limits (day/week/time)
- ✅ User can be coach in multiple venues
- ✅ Owner/admin can invite team members
- ✅ No breakage of Events functionality
